## Project Description
The unemployment rate is a key indicator of economic health. In this project, we analyze unemployment data across various regions in India to observe trends and patterns, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.

We aim to:
- Visualize the unemployment rate across different regions.
- Analyze the trend of unemployment over time.
- Identify any correlations or insights from the dataset.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis-india.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd unemployment-analysis-india
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
